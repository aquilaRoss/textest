\subsection{Birthplaces}
This section is about establishing the origin of your character, where they were born and the environment they grew up in. The birthplace you select will influence your character's skills, perks, and potentially their story. Keep in mind that your character's race must match one of the options in the province or country, or you will need to provide an in-game explanation for why your character originates there.
