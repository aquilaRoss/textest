\subsubsubsection{Breakland of Daetarre}
The Breaklands of Daetarre are a fractured archipelago of fiercely independent city-states, spread across a rugged coastal landmass surrounded on all sides by sea. The Breaklands are a mosaic of competing port-cities, merchant republics, cliffhold enclaves, and storm-battered hillforts—each with its own laws, traditions, and ruling councils. What binds them is not a crown, but a shared maritime culture, ancestral reverence, a pact of mutual defence and non-aggression ratified through sea-oaths and seasonal gatherings. The region thrives on trade, seafaring, boasting fleets of windcutters, stormpriests, and salt-born diplomats. While they rarely act as one, the Breaklanders are highly adaptive, fiercely proud, and experts in both coastal warfare and political manoeuvrings. To outsiders, the Breaklands may seem divided—but beneath the shifting sails and rival banners lies a deep unity born of survival, sea, and storm.
