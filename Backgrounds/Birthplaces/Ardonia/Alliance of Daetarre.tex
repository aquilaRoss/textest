\subsubsubsection{Alliance of Daetarre}
The Alliance of Daetarre is a loose but enduring confederation of highland city-states, cliffhold dominions, and forestbound enclaves nestled along the northwestern mountains beyond Mon'ur's borders. Formed centuries ago to repel invasions and preserve autonomy, the Alliance is bound by mutual defence pacts, trade accords, and deep cultural respect for ancestral rites, elemental magic, and martial honour. Though each member-state retains its sovereignty, they convene through the Stone Accord Council, where leaders debate through ritualized challenge or vote. Known for producing elite rangers, sky-climbers, and storm-scribes, the Daetarre Alliance maintains a rugged neutrality, serving as both a buffer and a wildcard in the ongoing tensions between Mon'ur and the Kingdom of Macedon.
