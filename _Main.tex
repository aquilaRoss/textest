\subsection{Drakien}
“So many friends gone, and for what purpose” - Victor Drakor, Grand Master of the Watchers of Reliance
This race was made by dragons, and said to be the mixture of Elves and Dragons who took a human like form. The god known as Reliance has direct descendants that have ruled much of the Isles of Appia since the 1st Devourer war and the Dragon isles for even longer.
Appearance
Drakiens are tall, powerful humanoids who embody a regal fusion of elven grace and draconic heritage. Drakiens possess broad, commanding physiques built for both nobility and war. Their skin ranges in tone from warm human hues to a distinctive copper-toned sheen that catches the light with a faint glow. Upon closer inspection, this skin reveals a fine scale-like texture, most notably along the neck, where overlapping draconic scales subtly rise from the collarbone to the jawline—an elegant yet undeniable marker of their bloodline.
Their facial features are angular and striking, with high cheekbones, defined jawlines, and intense, glowing eyes that range in colours like golden yellow, fiery red, or deep violet—each with vertical, reptilian pupils that betray their ancient ancestry. Drakiens have slightly elongated ears that sweep back close to the skull, a trait that gives them an elven silhouette without fully matching their kin. 
Subtle bone ridges are sometimes present along the cheekbones or brows, and in rare cases, short horn stubs or claw-like protrusions appear on their forearms. Hair is typically dark—ranging from deep brown to black—and worn long, often braided or tied back, especially among warriors and nobles.

\subsection{Dune Lizards}
“Friends are not plentiful , to much hatred for us since the Devourer Wars” - Amagat Barakis - Mage of Gallamor
The Lizards are warm blooded and they were once as numerous as the Human race but they made an error of picking the wrong side during the Devourer Wars that resulted in the other races committing mass genocide upon their race. Only the Dune Lizards remain and since the Cataclysm they are not hated as they once were but some of the races with longer lifespans tend to view them with distrust. They are Proud and Loyal and this tendency has sometimes led to their undoing.
Appearance 
Dune Lizards are tall, humanoid reptilian beings shaped by the harsh environments of the desert. Their physiques are built for endurance and survival, with dense musculature, thick hide-like scales, and an imposing presence.
Their skin is made of rough, scaled plates in desert-adapted tones—ranging from sun-bleached sand and muted grey to earthen rust and deep slate. Bone protrusions are commonly visible on the head, forehead, or jawline, giving many individuals a naturally armoured look. Their heads are distinctly lizard-like: elongated, with slitted nostrils, sharp eyes, and no visible external ears. Their eyes are typically reptilian—bright, reflective, and well-suited for navigating both searing daylight and moonlit dunes.
Each hand and foot ends in four digits tipped with curved talons, capable of gripping, climbing, and slashing. Their tails, though often partially hidden beneath layered desert wrappings or armour, provide balance and can be used in combat or defence.
Height and Weights
Dune Lizards Male and Female height is very similar between 5'5ft - 6'5ft. Dune Lizard females are slightly broader than males but average weight is 85-140kg.
Life Expectancy
Their lifetime commonly ranges from 70-90 years due to their constitution. Has a normal sleeping pattern like humans.
