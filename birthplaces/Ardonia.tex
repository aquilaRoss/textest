\subsubsection{Continent of Ardonia}

Ardonia is a vast and culturally diverse continental realm forged from the remnants of ancient empires, divine wars, and shattered alliances. It spans across fertile plains, jagged mountain ranges, highland forests, and war-torn borders, and is home to a web of interconnected governments, each rooted in shared history but divided by geography, ideology, and ambition.

Ardonia is governed by noble houses who operate within semi-autonomous realms, tied together by shared faiths, trade routes, and historical treaties. The people of Ardonia are very professional and proud of their jobs.
